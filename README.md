# How does this work?
Andronix Commands is a part of Andronix App that lets you **copy and sync** saved commands on all your machines so that you don't forget your 50 character long commands ðŸ˜…. 



# Get started now ðŸš€
To get started with Commands, you need to have a Andronix Premium account, which is a one time payment and unlocks a bunch on things for the price. After purchasing the Premium you're all set.

You can use commands on web @ https://web.andronix.app
or by visiting the Commands section of the app.

#  Technical Details ðŸ’»
Here are some details regarding the web app which should be very obvious to some but not to the others.

This project doesn't uses any **JavaScript Framework** being a very simple application, it had to be as light as possible. The project is hosted on **Firebase Hosting** and gets bundled and minified by **Parcel** and the CSS is optimised with **postcss-uncss for Parcel**.
